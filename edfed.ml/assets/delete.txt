things needing delete:

cutabove
    remove their "stg1w1_applied_for..." status from cutabove_workshop (member_id_1a...)
        go to every stg1w1_applied_for, stg1w2_applied_for etc in the cutabove row, and set the corresponding workshop's member_id_#a to be 0 WHERE member_id_#a = cutabove.clg_reg
    remove their "stg1w1..." (completed) status from cutabove_workshop (member_id_1...)
        go to every stg1w1, stg1w2 etc in the cutabove row, and set the corresponding workshop's member_id_# to be 0 WHERE member_id_# = cutabove.clg_reg
cutabove_council
    remove their applied for entry at cutabove_workshop (supervisor_id_1..., supervisor_id_1a...)
        find all rows in cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo where supervisor_id = cutabove_council.council_id
        go to all workshops where cutabove_workshop.workshop_id = cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo.workshop_id and remove supervisor_id_# and supervisor_id_#a that match cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo.supervisor_id
    remove their applied for/completed entry at cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo
        got to the row where cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo.supervisor_id = cutabove_council.council_id and remove that row
cutabove_workshop
    remove its "member_id_1",  "member_id_1a" from cutabove (stg1w1_applied_for, stg1w1)
        find the cutabove.clg_reg from each "member_id_#",  "member_id_#a" column and go to that cutabove.clg_reg
        find the (cutabove_workshop.level_name)_applied_for and (cutabove_workshop.level_name) to 0 where the value in this column = cutabove_workshop.workshop_id
            this is just a double safety check. 
            first check: row (cutabove.clg_reg) is found from member_id_# or member_id_#a, and column (cutabove.stg#w#_applied_for / cutabove.stg#w#) from cutabove_workshop.level_name
            second check: value is set to 0 only if pre-existing value was = cutabove_workshop.workshop_id
    remove its "supervisor_id_1", "supervisor_id_1a" from cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo (supervisor_id,supervisor_attendance)
        find the row in cutabove_workshop_supervisors_applied_fo where supervisor_id = "supervisor_id_1" or "supervisor_id_1a" and remove that row
